# Casino_Game
This C++ program on CASINO GAME is a simple text base number guessing game. I used procedure oriented approach to design this game. In this guessing game, the player can deposit his money to play. From this amount he can bet on number between 1 to 10. If he win he gets 10 times of money otherwise lost his money.
